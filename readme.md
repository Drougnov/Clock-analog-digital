## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Thanks for cheking out this repository.

## What is it about

It is a beautiful clock UI with theme switcher that shows current time and date. It is made with vanilla JS.

I've been practicing basic javascript project from [wesbos's javascript 30 course](https://courses.wesbos.com/account/access/62adf09d8ed3995269d75c5a). This is the day2 project. The UI was copied from [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bedimcode)

This project teaches(especially) you how to:

-create a theme switcher

-get current date and time
